All pieces in the board should be moved to the center square. 
Now, how many movements does it take for each piece to reach that square? If we draw the board
we get something like this

. . . .
 22222
 21112
 21012
 21112
 22222
. . . .

Thus, we get 8 squares in the shortest distance (other than 0). Then 16 in the second shortest one,
then 24, etc. So for distance in position i, we have 8i squares. So the answer we're looking for is
1 * 8 + 2 * 16 + 3 * 24 + 4 * 32 ... which can be rewritten as 8(1 + 4 + 27 + ... + ((n - 1) / 2) ^ 2.
Computing this number can be done either by iteration or by using the summation formula for E(n^2).
