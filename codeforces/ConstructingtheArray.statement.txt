This is an implementation problem. What we have to take care of is not making the 
search for the next segment too slow. This can be done using a heap in which we 
put the segments.
Segments can be compared by the diference of their limits (r - l) and we break ties
by comparing the l values.




class Segment{
	int l;
	int r;
	Segment(int l, int r){
		this.l = l;
		this.r = r;
	}
